Description: Terminal multiplexer library
 libttymultiplex is a terminal multiplexing library.
 .
 It allows a program to create "panes", which are a
 rectangular area on the terminal/screen in which text
 can be  displayed. Each pane is like a small terminal,
 escape sequences can be sent to them.
 .
 libttymultiplex is also a xterm-compatible  but still
 incomplete terminal emulator. The libttymultiplex library
 allows for different backends for displaying stuff, which
 allows it to be used on any display device any of the
 backends support.

Package: libttymultiplex-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libttymultiplex0 (=${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Terminal multiplexer library development files
 This contains the header files needed to use the libttymultiplex
 library in another c or c++ program. This package is only
 needed for building such a program though.

Package: libttymultiplex-doc
Section: doc
Architecture: all
Depends: libjs-jquery, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Terminal multiplexer library documentation of APIs and internals

Description: Metapackage for all backends
 This metapackage installs all libttymultiplex backends.
 Currently, there is only the libttymultiplex0-backend-curses
 backend, but other backends may be added in future versions.

Package: libttymultiplex0-backend-curses
Provides: libttymultiplex0-backend

Depends: libttymultiplex0 (=${binary:Version}), libncursesw5, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: curses backend for libttymultiplex
 This backend for libttymultiplex uses the curses library.
 With this backend, libttymultiplex can be used on an existing terminal,
 well, except maybe if your terminal is in fact a printer or something
 like that.
